        <h2 class="work-title underline">fullstack web developer</h2>
        <p class="welcome-text">Hello there üåà! I am a full-stack developer seeking new professional opportunities in full-stack, back-end, or front-end development. I am naturally curious, detail-oriented, and passionate about finding creative solutions to problems, streamlining processes, and developing products that meet market needs. Collaborating with others is important to me as I enjoy learning from fresh perspectives.</p>
        <p class="welcome-text">Lately, I've been focusing on enhancing my front-end skills, including practicing JavaScript, learning React, and exploring debugging tools like Chat GPT ü§ì, which has proven to be a valuable resource.</p>
        <p class="welcome-text">Thank you for visiting my website üíÉ! I hope you enjoy it.</p>

            <p class="project-description">This web app is an excellent work tool for midwives, providing them with a convenient way to receive new patient requests, create appointments using the calendar, and keep their work communication in one place using the chat box. My team and I developed this application using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL for the database. We also used AJAX and Stimulus JS to manipulate the page behavior for the chat box and implemented the Mapbox API to display a map for each appointment.</p>
            <p class="project-description">I'm proud to have been a part of this project, and I believe that this web app will be a valuable asset to the midwifery community.</p>

            <p class="project-description">I created a form using HTML and CSS that allows users to add a new dish to a cookbook. The cookbook is a Google Sheets doc that works as a simple database.</p>
            <p class="project-description">When the user submits the form information, it gets stored in the database using an API implemented with JavaScript and AJAX. This solution is ideal for projects that do not require a big database and only need to store small amounts of information.</p>

              <p class="project-description">Welcome to my personal website! Here you can find some of the projects I've been working on and have a closer impression of who I am. The website was developed with Html and CSS and is hosted on Github Pages. It was a great learning experience to use grid and the biggest challenge was to achieve a good responsivness in different screen sizes.</p>

          <img class="about-image" src="/documents/Catalina Acosta Rivera.jpg.jpg" alt="about image">
          <p class="about-text">I am originally from Bogot√°, Colombia, but I have been living in Europe for the past eight years. After spending three years in Barcelona, I moved to Berlin. I studied Fashion Design in Bogot√° and earned my Masters in Fashion Management in Barcelona. Since then, I have worked in the Fashion industry as an Account Manager and, most recently, as a Product Manager in Berlin.</p>
          <p class="about-text">During the Covid pandemic, I found myself with more free time than expected, which sparked my interest in web development and programming. To my surprise, I discovered that not only could I program (something I had thought was not an option for me for years), but it was also fun and creative.</p>
          <p class="about-text">In the autumn of 2022, I took the leap and enrolled in a 9-week intensive web development bootcamp at Le Wagon in Berlin. Since then, I have been convinced that I want to continue working as a developer and apply all my skills to it.</p>
          <p class="about-text" text-align="left">Fun fact: I have only lived in cities that start with the letter "B" üòÑ.</p>
          <p class="about-text" text-align="left">In addition to web development, I enjoy practicing yoga üßò, baking üßÅ, and dancing ü™©.</p>
